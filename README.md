# BTD6-Mods
Mods for BTD6 I have created

October 13th, 2023

I have accumulated a lot of simple mods here that are long broken and it seems no one is downloading them, so to clean things up here, I deleted them.

HOWEVER.

I will now leave BIG BOI mod in Tower Mods

DJDTowerPack:

Includes Necromancer, Teacher, Soldier, and Pizza towers, all in one!

Note: It requires

ModHelper(https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/tag/3.1.15)

I do not provide the source code for my mods as I've had mods stolen in the past, but I am willing to explain how any mechanic in my mods work or show snippits of the source code on Timotheees BTD6 modding discord https://discord.gg/7ctsMYkF
